# Steven Lambert's Dotfile

My personal dotfile setup to configure any new Mac, based on https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles.

## Features

* brew, brew cask, and nvm 
* Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Sublime Text, Slack, Postman, and Spotify
* iTerm with custom theme (based on Remy Sharp's terminal theme)
* custom Sublime Text settings and keybindings
* custom OS X Defaults configured to my liking

## Installation

This installation will overwrite all previous settings and files with no backups. It assumes the Mac is new so does not check before installing things and is expected to only run once. 

1. Download or clone the repository to any location
1. Run the main install script `sh install.sh`
1. Enter your password when prompted
